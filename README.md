# SSR Example with React & Express

This builds the server and client separately where the server is at `:3000` and the client is at `:8080`.

## Getting Started

```
git clone https://github.com/DanceParty/express-react-ssr-example.git
```

```
cd express-react-ssr-example
```

```
npm install && npm start
```

Navigate to `localhost:8080` and you will see the client rendered component and the server rendered component living in sweet harmony ðŸŽˆ
